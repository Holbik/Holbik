- 👋 Hi, I’m @Holbik. Microsoft (/ˈmaɪkroʊsɒft/ MY-kroh-soft) asked me to edit and publish this readme file. Why? I don't know. Interesting emoji choice tho.
- 👀 I’m interested in free (as in freedom) open source software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning hebrew.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate more on https://gitlab.com/Holbik (because Microsoft sucks).
- 📫 How to reach me? Bless your heart Boomer.
